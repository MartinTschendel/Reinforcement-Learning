# Reinforcement-Learning
In this repository, reinforcement learning algorithms are applied on a dataset, that simulates click through rates of different website advertisments. The content is based on the udemy course Machine Learning A-Z.<br>
These algorithms are useful if you do not have enough time to do an AB-Test. Exploration and exploitation of the best ad happen at the same time.
* Upper Confidence Bound
* Thompson Sampling
